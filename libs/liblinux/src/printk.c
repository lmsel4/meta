 * Modified to make sys_syslog() more flexible: added commands to
 * return the last 4k of kernel messages, regardless of whether
 * they've been read or not.  Added option to suppress kernel printk's
 * to the console.  Added hook for sending the console messages
 * elsewhere, in preparation for a serial line console (someday).
 * Ted Ts'o, 2/11/93.
 * Modified for sysctl support, 1/8/97, Chris Horn.
 * Fixed SMP synchronization, 08/08/99, Manfred Spraul

 * Rewrote bits to get rid of console_lock

/**
 * printk - print a kernel message
 * @fmt: format string
 *
 * This is printk(). It can be called from any context. We want it to work.
 *
 * We try to grab the console_lock. If we succeed, it's easy - we log the
 * output and call the console drivers.  If we fail to get the semaphore, we
 * place the output into the log buffer and return. The current holder of
 * the console_sem will notice the new output in console_unlock(); and will
 * send it to the consoles before releasing the lock.
 *
 * One effect of this deferred printing is that code which calls printk() and
 * then changes console_loglevel may break. This is because console_loglevel
 * is inspected when the actual printing occurs.
 *
 * See also:
 * printf(3)
 *
 * See the vsnprintf() documentation for format string extensions over C99.
